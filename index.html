          <p>My hobby is Drawing and painting.I think drawing is the best hobby. You can create art anywhere as long as you have two things: pencils and paper. <br><br>It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start using your brain and to be creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills and develop learning skills.I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness.Even Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and start thinking in a different way.<br><br> Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open ended thinking and creativity.<br><br> These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems. Skills you learn through sketching can be applied in a number of different areas in your life.
          Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life and career.<br><br> It also develops hand-eye coordination so that everyday tasks can become easier for you. But it also develops strategic thinking, something which everyone needs to be able to do some amount of.</p>
